What is this?
=========
A square-1 image generator.

How to use it?
=========

`https://cubeshape.herokuapp.com/cubeshape/[shape]`

Where [shape] is formed from **c** (corner) and **e** (edge) characters.
The default image size is 200px, but can be set via the size query parameter.

The colors are fixed as of now (red for edges, orange for corners), but I'm planning to add color customization options & side stickers if there are people interested.
